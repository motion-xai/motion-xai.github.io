    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Control and Automation Engineering, with a specialization in multibody systems modeling and robotic control. During my doctoral research at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), I co-founded a startup that developed a cloud-based platform to enhance academic collaboration and productivity.
Currently, as Research Programs Lead Engineer at AVL, I manage R&D projects focused on connected and autonomous mobility, leveraging expertise in vehicle dynamics, motion planning, and high-fidelity simulations. I also contribute to proving ground tests for automated driving systems and modules.</p>
